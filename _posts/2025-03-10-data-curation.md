Renewable energy has been a hot topic in recent decades because of things like climate change, air quality, and energy spending. However, I wanted to answer a different question: how does renewable energy affect electricity costs? In order to answer this question, we need some data. This post will explore some techniques of obtaining data that isn't readily available. 

## Motivating Question
First, let's clarify our motivation for asking this question. Since there is (theoretically) an infinite supply of things like sunlight and wind, shouldn't that energy be cheaper? On the other hand, maybe the infrastructure for renewable energy is more expensive, causing electicity prices to go up. In either case, if there is a relationship between renewable energy production and electricity costs, I think we'd all like to know about it!

## Data Source

To answer this question, I obtained data from the <a href="https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data.php" target="_blank">US Energy Information Association</a>. I downloaded two separate data sets: one for energy production and one for average energy prices. Unfortunately, there isn't a single data set that has all of the data that we need, so we will have to combine the data from these two data sets into one. Because this data is freely available on a government website, this use of data is ethical. 

## Combining the Data

To save time, I won't go into every detail of how I cleaned and merged these data sets. I have provided a link to a GitHub repository that contains the final data set and the code I wrote to obtain it. 

Because we are interested in how the growth of **renewable** energy affects prices, I filtered the energy production data to only include renewable sources. Then I added up all renewable energy production (in megawatt hours) for each month. Within the electricity prices data set, I averaged the prices for each month and for each sector (residential, industrial, commercial, and all). Once all of this was done, I cleaned the data to make sure column names matched and that the lengths of each data set was the same. Then I merged the two data sets into one final data set that we can use to answer our question. 

## Exploring the Data

The data set contains the following columns: `Month`, `Year`, `price_all`,  `price_residential`, `price_industrial`, `price_commercial`, and `Total_Renewable_Generation_MWh`. It contains data for every month from 2001 through 2023 and contains 276 rows. 

Now that we have the data we want, let's take a look at it!

## Conclusion

Phew. Let's review what we've gone over today. First, we asked an important question: how does the growth of renewable energy affect electricity costs? To answer this question, we downloaded two separate data sets from the <a href="https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data.php" target="_blank">US Energy Information Association</a>. One of these data sets detailed energy production while the other gave information about electricity prices. We manipulated these data sets to get the information we wanted from each one, and then we combined them into one data set. To finish, we took a look at the data set that we just created. **describe what plots maybe, once you put those in**. In my next post, I'll continue with this question and attempt to answer it using the data we have gathered here. 

If you'd like to practice, try creating the data set that I made! If you need hints or help, the code I used can be found in <a href="https://github.com/astrad77/Data-Curation?tab=readme-ov-file" target="_blank">this GitHub repository</a>. Once you've tried that, ask your own data science question and find the data to answer it!
